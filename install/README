Nays 2D Flood is a flood flow analysis solver that relies on unsteady 2-dimensional plane flow simulation using boundary-fitted coordinates  as the general curvilinear coordinates. This solver adopts the 2-dimensional plane flow simulation of the Nays2D Solver developed by Professor Yasuyuki Shimizu of Hokkaido University for flood flow analysis. 

The solver easily enables the user to set the inflow conditions of an arbitrary number of inflow rivers that enter from the upstream end or sides of a river. It has been applied to the flood flow analysis of small/mid-scale rivers. Because the solver does not require river channel data, it is also used for the flood process analysis of primitive rivers and rivers in developing countries.
